Group_E_Practical 5: HEAP SORT AND SHELL SORT IN JAVA : Implement the Heap/Shell sort algorithm implemented in Java demonstrating heap/shell
data structure with modularity of programming language.

Group_B_Practical 6: BINARY SEARCH TREE : Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree - 
i. Insert new node, 
ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root, 
iii. Minimum data value found in the tree, 
iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node, 
v. Search a value

Group_D_Practical 19 : AVL TREE : A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new
keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display
whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum
comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the
complexity for finding a keyword
