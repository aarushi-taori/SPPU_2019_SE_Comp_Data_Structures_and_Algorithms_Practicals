__GROUP A:

Practical 2: DICTIONARY USING CHAINING : Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing and handle collisions using chaining with / without replacement. Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)

**GROUP B:

Practical 6: BINARY SEARCH TREE : Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree - 
i. Insert new node, 
ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root, 
iii. Minimum data value found in the tree, 
iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node, 
v. Search a value

Practical 7 : EXPRESSION TREE : Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +--a*bc/def and traverse it using post order traversal (non recursive) and then delete the entire tree.

Practical 11 : DICTIONARY USING BINARY SEARCH TREE : A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Binary Search Tree for implementation.

**GROUP C: 

Practical 13 : GRAPH : Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.

**GROUP D :

Practical 19 : AVL TREE : A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword

**GROUP E : 

Practical 5: HEAP SORT AND SHELL SORT IN JAVA : Implement the Heap/Shell sort algorithm implemented in Java demonstrating heap/shell data structure with modularity of programming language.

**GROUP F : 

Practical 23 : SEQUENTIAL FILES : Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential file to main the data.
